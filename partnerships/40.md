Objectives
----------

To formalise and improve the engagement between statutory bodies and NGOs on the issues of human trafficking and to inform the development of human trafficking policy and programmes. The purpose, role and remit of the Group is set out in the Term of Reference (attached separately). The Engagement Group has an Awareness Subgroup which aims to co-ordinate consistent and effective awareness raising activities on human trafficking and has recently established a Subgroup for Support Providers. Separately, a Sex Work Liaison Group has also been established which brings together DOJ, PSNI, health workers and sex worker representatives with a view to tackling human trafficking within the sex industry. Following the establishment of the Liaison Group, DOJ and PSNI jointly ran an education / awareness session with sex workers, hosted by Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Feedback for this event was very positive with a number of sex workers indicating that they would be more likely in future to report concerns to PSNI. A number of proactive Human Trafficking Investigations have been commenced as a direct result of engagement of this nature.
