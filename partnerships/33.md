Objectives
----------

This group meets 6 times a year per county.  It takes the form of a workshop to focus on gaps identified by the partnership. The members of this group are the operational and day to day frontline staff of various agencies across the county, including Healthcare, Trading Standards, Community Safety Partnerships, CSE teams, Victim Support, Social Care, Children Services, Foster Carers, UASC, Education, Sexual Health (nurses), Fire, Immigration, HMRC, Social Workers, Health and Wellbeing teams and NGOs. 
The aim of the workshops is to support the implementation of action plans, policies and procedures. They will consider victim support, data collection and data sharing agreements and review procedures, training and awareness raising campaigns, to encourage compliance with statutory obligations and national guidance. The workshops will also focus on the challenges faced by frontline teams and how to establish a proactive rather than a reactive approach.
