Objectives
----------

In order to actively target Organised Crime Groups throughout Teesside, multi-agency groups have been formed at a disruption, bronze, silver and gold level. Each group’s overarching mission is to disrupt and dismantle members of OCGs, thereby reducing the risk and harm to the local community including residents, business and the environment. 
This will be delivered by addressing the 4 P’s of the Serious and Organised Crime Strategy:

* Pursue
* Prevent
* Protect
* Prepare

Strategic Aims

* To make Teesside a safer place to live and work
* To pursue OCG’s by effectively sharing and using intelligence and multi-agency resources to maximise impact and disruption resulting in the total dismantling of OCGs
* To increase confidence in our local communities that all statutory agencies actively pursue
* To protect and reduce the number of victims of OCG’s
