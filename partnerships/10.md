Objectives
----------

The purpose of the Anti-Slavery Partnership is to oversee co-ordination of a consistent multi-agency partnership approach to tackling modern slavery across Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent. The Partnership have developed a joint Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent MDS action plan (attached) which clearly outlines the roles and responsibilities of partners, actions required and timescales. The Partnership is organised into two main groups - the time-limited Strategic Task and Finish Group who oversee the development of the Action Plan and the ongoing Operational Group who facilitate and support multi-agency involvement and co-operation in enforcement activity. Subject specific Sub-Groups have been set up to develop consistent, co-ordinated approaches to training, safeguarding referral routes and communications. All Task Groups have a different Chair Person to involve all partners in the developments.
