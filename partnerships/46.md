Objectives
----------

London Working Group's main objective are to  use the expertise of the group to support councils to better identify and support victims; Provide info to pan London services; Be a pan-London voice (e.g. [submission to Mayor for his plan](http://www.humantraffickingfoundation.org/sites/default/files/HT%26MDS%20London%20Working%20Group%27s%20Submission%20-%20The%20Mayor%27s%20Police%20%26%20Crime%20Plan%20Consultation.pdf)); create best practice protocols for local authorities etc..).   It was initially just set up to support our London work with councils ([info here](http://www.humantraffickingfoundation.org/supporting-london-boroughs-response-modern-slavery)) but has increasingly become a pan-London voice.
