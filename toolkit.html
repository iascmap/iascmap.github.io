  			<h1>Help us to build a partnership toolkit!</h1>

			<p>The Slavery-Free Communities team at the University of Nottingham is building a new Anti-Slavery Partnership toolkit to assist communities and service providers in working together to improve responses to modern slavery.</p>

			<p>This resource will help with:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Determining your need for an anti-slavery partnership</li>
				<li>Identifying appropriate partners and seeking engagement</li>
				<li>Setting an agenda and developing a work-plan</li>
				<li>Taking joint actions</li>
				<li>Securing resources</li>
				<li>Establishing partnership governance and accountability frameworks</li>
				<li>Measuring and monitoring performance</li>
				<li>Engaging with survivors</li>
				<li>Increasing public awareness, community mobilisation and co-production</li>
				<li>Connecting with other partnerships and feeding in to the national picture</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Send us your ideas</h2>
			<p>In order to help gather existing best practice, we would appreciate information and examples relating to any of the above points.</p>
			<p>For instance, case studies of initiatives that have worked well, examples of action plans, information-sharing agreements, modern slavery statements and monitoring frameworks.</p>

			<p>This project is a collaborative effort and so any partnerships wanting to share their experience and information can get in contact directly with us at the following address:</p>
