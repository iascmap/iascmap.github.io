  			<h1>Help us to build a partnership toolkit!</h1>

			<p>We are building an online toolkit for local anti-slavery partnerships, which will assist communities and service providers to improve their responses to modern slavery.</p>

			<p>The toolkit will include checklists, documents and helpful links to assist with key actions including:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Initiating partnerships and establishing a shared agenda</li>
				<li>Setting goals and constructing action plans</li>
				<li>Governance and accountability frameworks, including measuring progress</li>
				<li>Engaging with survivors</li>
				<li>Increasing public awareness, community mobilisation and co-production</li>
			</ul>
